Welcome to the infopage of the **Global Freshwater Systems Science Workshop**.

We are an informal, open, and growing collective of interdisciplinary scientists broadly working on global-scale research topics relating to the interconnections between humans, ecosystems, Earth systems, and freshwater systems. Our work spans all components of the global hydrological cycle, including surface water, soil moisture, groundwater, atmospheric water, and frozen water, their interconnections, and their connections to people and ecosystems. 

We seek to be a leading voice in the global water resilience discourse and collaborate with researchers with diverse worldviews, backgrounds, and methods to enrich our science. 

**We organize semi-annual workshops where we convene, share, brainstorm, and collaborate**.
